## Intro to Arrays

Last session, we learned about basic Data Types and variables and how we can use these to store data in a program. We also got some practice collaborating and communicating in structured breakout rooms. Today, we are going to take that a bit further as we learn how to use Arrays to organize related data together, using similar structures to collaborate and communicate.

We will breakout into program specific groups to learn how to use these more advanced Data Types!
