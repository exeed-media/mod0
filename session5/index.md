- Use basic Array methods to manipulate data in Arrays

## Agenda

- Housekeeping
- Homework 4 Share Out
- Arrays
- Closing and Announcements

## Intro to Arrays

Last session, we learned about basic Data Types and variables and how we can use these to store data in a program. We also got some practice collaborating and communicating in structured breakout rooms. Today, we are going to take that a bit further as we learn how to use Arrays to organize related data together, using similar structures to collaborate and communicate.

We will breakout into program specific groups to learn how to use these more advanced Data Types!

## Closing and Announcements

* This is your last Mod 0 Session!
* Remaining deliverables - complete the HW5/Assessment and turn in your Mod 0 Project
* Check the calendar for Mod 1 Orientation
* Moving forward:
  * Keep up the hard work
  * Keep asking questions in your cohort channels

* Learning to code is much more like exercise than epiphanies - Think about MJ!

> Quote from Meg Stang (BE instructor) - "I've noticed that the students that do the bare minimum on their Mod 0 Project are the ones that usually struggle for at least the first half of the mod."

> Quote from Tara Westover (author of the book Educated) - "In retrospect, I see that this was my education... the hours I spent sitting at a borrowed desk, struggling to parse narrow strands of Mormon doctrine... This skill I was learning was a crucial one, the patience to read things I could not yet understand."

When you're finished with your Mod 0 Project, work on the suggested exercises. Not sure what to work on at that point? Ask!
