## Mod 0 Technical Assessment

We've come to the end of our instruction in Mod 0 ðŸ˜­! Which means that you are ready to crush your Mod 0 Technical Assessment!

Be sure to check your calendar for when your assessment is due! 

Your technical assessment consists of two parts:
- A 25 minute, program specific, timed multiple choice test
- A 60 minute exercise utilzing git, GitHub and your understanding of core concepts from Mod 0

You are free to use your notes, online resources, etc. but please be mindful of the time you are taking to complete the assessment!

After completing the assessment, your instructors will evaluate your readiness for Mod 0 based on your technical proficiency. They will determine one of three outcomes:
1. Passing technical assessment, no revisions required
2. Passing technical assessment after a small number of revisions
3. Failing technical assessment, requires repeat of Mod 0

As a reminder, the technical assessment is only ONE of the data points we use to evaluate readiness for the program. You may still be asked to repeat Mod 0 if you have struggled to show proficiency with professional skills, accountability, interpersonal skills, etc.

## Intro to Arrays

Last session, we learned about basic Data Types and variables and how we can use these to store data in a program. We also got some practice collaborating and communicating in structured breakout rooms. Today, we are going to take that a bit further as we learn how to use Arrays to organize related data together, using similar structures to collaborate and communicate.

We will breakout into program specific groups to learn how to use these more advanced Data Types!

### Close out

* This is your last Mod 0 Session!
* Remaining deliverables - complete the Mod 0 Assessment and turn in your Mod 1 Pre-work
* Check the calendar for Mod 1 Orientation
* Moving forward:
  * Keep up the hard work
  * Keep asking questions in your cohort channels

* Learning to code is much more like exercise than epiphanies - Think about MJ!

> Quote from Meg Stang (BE instructor) - "I've noticed that the students that do the bare minimum on their mod 1 pre-work are the ones that usually struggle for at least the first half of the mod."

> Quote from Tara Westover (author of the book Educated) - "In retrospect, I see that this was my education... the hours I spent sitting at a borrowed desk, struggling to parse narrow strands of Mormon doctrine... This skill I was learning was a crucial one, the patience to read things I could not yet understand."

When you're finished with your pre-work, work on the suggested exercises. Not sure what to work on at that point? Ask!
