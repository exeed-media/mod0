## Iteration

Iteration (or looping for a specified number of times) is a process of repeating a task for each object in a collection. For each of the scenarios below, we'll walk through step by step to demonstrate the concept.

### Iteration in Real Life

These are examples that would be programatically challenging because they would require a ton of steps, but are things that we do everyday.

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Scenario</th>
      <th>Collection</th>
      <th>For each...</th>
      <th>Do this:</th>
      <th>Then:</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>Grading papers</td>
      <td>papers</td>
      <td>paper</td>
      <td>
        <ol>
          <li>read through it</li>
          <li>mark the score on the top</li>
        </ol>
      </td>
      <td>repeat with next paper</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Feeding animals</td>
      <td>animals</td>
      <td>animal</td>
      <td>
        <ol>
          <li>bring the animal to the food bucket</li>
          <li>allow the animal to eat</li>
          <li>bring animal back to barn</li>
        </ol>
      </td>
      <td>repeat with next animal</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

### Iteration in Programming

By "in programming", we mean things that could be done, with relative ease, by a computer. Like crunching numbers.

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Scenario</th>
      <th>Collection</th>
      <th>For each...</th>
      <th>Do this:</th>
      <th>Then:</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>Calculating max heart rate</td>
      <td>birth years</td>
      <td>year</td>
      <td>
        <ol>
          <li>subtract birth year from the current year to get age</li>
          <li>subtract age from 220</li>
        </ol>
      </td>
      <td>repeat with next year</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Formatting names</td>
      <td>names</td>
      <td>name</td>
      <td>
        <ol>
          <li>capitalize the first letter</li>
          <li>lowercase all remaining letters</li>
        </ol>
      </td>
      <td>repeat with next name</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<div class="try-it">
  <h3>Try It: Iteration in Real Life and Programming</h3>
  <p>Brainstorm a real life scenario that uses iteration. Fill out the table below and be ready to share.</p>
  <table>
    <thead>
      <tr>
        <th>Scenario</th>
        <th>Collection</th>
        <th>For each...</th>
        <th>Do this:</th>
        <th>Then:</th>
      </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
      <tr>
        <td><textarea rows="4"></textarea></td>
        <td><textarea rows="4"></textarea></td>
        <td><textarea rows="4"></textarea></td>
        <td><textarea rows="4"></textarea></td>
        <td><textarea rows="4"></textarea></td>
      </tr>
    </tbody>
  </table>
  <p>Think back to your grocery store app. What is something you said you'd keep inside of an array? Why might you need to iterate over that collection? Jot down your scenario below.</p>
  <table>
    <thead>
      <tr>
        <th>Scenario</th>
        <th>Collection</th>
        <th>For each...</th>
        <th>Do this:</th>
        <th>Then:</th>
      </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
      <tr>
        <td><textarea rows="4"></textarea></td>
        <td><textarea rows="4"></textarea></td>
        <td><textarea rows="4"></textarea></td>
        <td><textarea rows="4"></textarea></td>
        <td><textarea rows="4"></textarea></td>
      </tr>

### Iteration Syntax

We'll go into breakout rooms to briefly discuss the syntax for iterating in Ruby and JavaScript. (15-18 min)

<div>
  Are you a <button class="iteration-toggle" id="fe-show">front end</button> or <button class="iteration-toggle" id="be-show">back end</button> student?
<div class="hidden fe-iteration">
  <p>The code that you see below is written using JavaScript. This syntax is something that you'll see all over the place, so it's important to get used to it. You don't need to memorize every little symbol for now, but knowing how to explain the big pieces is important.</p>
  <h4>Example #1: Grading papers for five students</h4>
  <iframe height="350px" width="100%" src="//repl.it/@rwarbelow/mod0iterationJS1?lite=true"></iframe>
  <div class="things-to-note">
    <h4>Things to Note: For Loop Vocabulary</h4>
    <ul>
      <li><code>var students = ['Megan', 'Jose', 'Xavier', 'Ali', 'Miriam'];</code><br> We use Javascript keyword <code>var</code> to <span class="vocab">declare</span> a <span class="vocab">variable</span> <code>students</code> and assign the <span class="vocab">array</span> of <span class="vocab">strings</span> to the <span class="vocab">variable</span> <code>students</code>.</li>
      <li><code>for (i = 0; i < students.length; i++)</code><br> We use Javascript keyword <code>for</code> to begin setting up our <span class="vocab">for loop</span> which we will break down further.</li>
      <li><code>i = 0;</code><br><span class="vocab">Declare</span> our <span class="vocab">variable</span> <code>i</code> and assign it to the <span class="vocab">integer</span> 0</li>
      <li><code>i < students.length;</code><br> We set up our <span class="vocab">conditional</span> statement that the <span class="vocab">for loop</span> will evaluate before entering the loop. On the first run through <code>i = 0</code>, so this statement evaluates to <code>0 < students.length;</code>, which can be broken down further to <code>0 < 5</code>, which evaluates to true. Think of <span class="vocab">conditionals</span> as questions that always evaluate to true or false.
      </li>
      <li><code>i++</code><br>Our <span class="vocab">incrementer</span> that will add one to i each time we pass through the loop. Another way to think about it is each time <code>i < students.length</code> is true we will increment <code>i</code> by one for the next time we evaluate the <span class="vocab">conditional</span> <code>i < students.length</code> So, after we've run through the <span class="vocab">for loop</span> once, the <span class="vocab">for loop</span> looks like this: <code>(i = 1; i < students.length; i++)</code> the second time through. This can break down further to <code>(i = 1; 1 < 5; i++)</code></li>
      <li><strong>Curly Brackets or Curly Braces:</strong>
      <code><br>
        {
          Within these brackets is where we do some kind of programming/logic to each element of our collection within our loop
        }
      </code><br>
      <strong>Todo:</strong> Google <code>console.log</code> and other console methods that are available to you in a Javascript console.</li>
      <li><code>students[i]</code><br> Access the <span class="vocab">element</span> of the <code>students</code> <span class="vocab">array</span> at <span class="vocab">index position</span><code>i</code> which will change as <code>i</code> changes and we increment through the <span class="vocab">for loop</span>
      As we move through the loop this breaks down to <code>students[0]</code>, next time through the loop: <code>students[1]</code>, next time through the loop: <code>students[2]</code> ...</li>
    </ul>

## BREAK

Turn off your mics and videos and walk away from the computer. Stand up, stretch, drink water. Do a few sit-ups, squats, push-ups, jumping jacks, arm circles, stress ball squeezes, or whatever else moves your body.
<hr>

<a name="errors"></a>
## Error Messages

Error messages are a beautiful thing. Learning how to read errors is very important in programming because they can tell you <em>exactly</em> where you made a mistake.

But error messages can be overwhelming if you're not used to them because they might overload you with information or use terms you don't understand.

What are some strategies that you have already been using to interpret error messages?

### Program Specific Breakout Groups (Groups of 3-4, 20 minutes)

<div class="try-it">
  <h3>Mythical Creatures: A Primer</h3>
  <p>Everyone should do a fist to five to show their comfort with error messages. Whoever is the least comfortable with errors will share their screen. Whoever is sharing their screen will be the driver. Every other person in the room will be a navigator.</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Clone and cd into the repo:</li>
      <ul>
        <li><a href="https://github.com/corneliusellen/mythical-creatures-primer-fe">Frontend version</a></li>
        <li><a href="https://github.com/corneliusellen/mythical-creatures-primer">Backend version</a></li>
      </ul>
      <li>Run the file with the command <code>ruby yeti.rb</code> for BE or <code>node yeti.js</code> for FE.</li>
      <li>Discuss with your group what you think the error message means.</li>
      <li>Fix the error.</li>
      <li>Repeat step 2-4 until there are no more errors. You will know you are making progress if the error messages change.</li>
    </ol>

  <p>You've corrected all the errors when you see the single line <code>We'll have to outwit the Bumble with our superior intelligence</code> outputted to your terminal.</p>

  <p><b>Note: To fix the errors, you shouldn't just delete entire lines of code. Only update lines or add them.</b></p>
</div>

### Close out

* This is your last mod 0 session
* All that's left is to turn in your mod 1 pre-work
* Check the calendar: Mod 1 Orientation is Nov 11
* When you start working on Mythical Creatures in Mod 1, think back to OOP, classes and methods in Mod 0
* Moving forward:
  * Keep up the hard work
  * Keep asking questions in your cohort channels

* Learning to code is much more like exercise than epiphanies - Think about MJ!

> Quote from Meg Stang (BE instructor) - "I've noticed that the students that do the bare minimum on their mod 1 pre-work are the ones that usually struggle for at least the first half of the mod."

When you're finished with your pre-work, work on the suggested exercises. Not sure what to work on at that point? Ask!
