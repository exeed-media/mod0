## Create your Homework Board

All of the Mod 0 work is organized on a [Mod 0 Trello board](https://trello.com/b/S7nxD03M/m0-homework). Trello is a tool that allows us to make a card for each task, and store cards under various columns. This type of tool is frequently used in software development.

**Action Item:**
- ðŸ“Œ Follow the directions on the first card titled "What is Trello + Copy this Board!"

## Budgeting Time & Communicating Proactively

During your time in Mod 0, you will have homework that is due after each session. The `Before Mod 0` activities can be considered your first homework assignment that will be due before the first session!

In addition to your homework assignments, you will also have to work on your Mod 0 Project throughout the course of Mod 0. Details are available on the pages for those requirements and will be covered during the first Mod 0 session, but be prepared to budget around 40 additional hours to complete these assignments! As you can imagine, time management will be crucial to successfully completing Mod 0 and the Turing program.

If you believe you may be falling behind, it is your responsibility to proactively reach out to your instructors to strategize - treat your instructors as your colleagues **and** your project managers!

## Getting Feedback on Homework

Your instructors will leave feedback directly on your homework Gists by leaving a comment. You should ensure that you have Notifications set in your GitHub that will alert you when someone comments via email.

For your homework and Mod 0 Project you will be receiving feedback directly in GitHub via comments and/or Issues. 

## Stuck?

The homework and Mod 0 Project are designed to push you out of your comfort zone. We are looking to see how you grapple with these concepts and are not as concerned about getting a correct solution. However, if you do get stuck be sure to ask your question in your Mod 0 Slack channel! This will lead to the fastest answers to your questions and will allow everyone to benefit from the question you ask.
