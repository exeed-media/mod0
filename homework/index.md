### Creating your HW Board

All of the mod 0 work is organized on a [Mod 0 Trello board](https://trello.com/b/2SkOztic/mod-0)

This board allows for a methodology called kanban (I would google the term if you're unfamiliar) to organize and update you tasks

When you've finished your homework for a given session, and you're looking for something to do, you can always rely on the mod 1 pre-work as that outlet! Just find the link in the sidebar for your program.

## Stuck?
The homework and Mod 1 Prework are designed to push you out of your comfort zone. We are looking to see how you grapple with these concepts and are not as concerned about getting a correct solution. However, if you do get stuck be sure to ask your question in your Mod 0 Slack channel! This will lead to the fastest answers to your questions and will allow everyone to benefit from the question you ask.

However, before asking your question(s) be sure to check out [this guide](https://gist.github.com/ericweissman/fb0241e226227867b6bc70a4d49227f5) for asking questions effectively!
