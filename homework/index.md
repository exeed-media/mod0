### Creating your HW Board

All of the Mod 0 work is organized on a [Mod 0 Trello board](https://trello.com/b/2SkOztic/mod-0).

This board allows for a methodology called kanban (I would google the term if you're unfamiliar) to organize and update you tasks.

### Mod 0 Homework, Mod 0 Technical Assessment, Mod 1 Pre-work
During your time in Mod 0, you will have homework that is due after Sessions 1-4. The `Before Mod 0` activities can be considered your first homework assignment that will be due before the first session! 

In addition to your homework assignments, you will also have to work on your Mod 1 Pre-work throughout the course of Mod 0, and the Mod 0 Technical Assessment to complete after Session 5. Check the Mod 1 Pre-work section and Mod 0 Assessment section for more details, but be prepared to budget around 40-50 additional hours to complete these assignments! As you can imagine, time management will be crucial to successfully completing Mod 0 and the Turing program.

If you believe you may be falling behind, it is your responsibility to proactively reach out to your instructors to strategize - treat your instructors as your colleagues AND your project managers!

## Getting Feedback on HW
Your instructors will leave feedback directly on your homework Gists by leaving a comment. You should ensure that you have Notifications set in your GitHub that will alert you when someone comments via email.

For your homework, Mod 0 Technical Assessment and Mod 1 Pre-work you will be receiving feedback directly in GitHub via comments and/or Issues. 

## Stuck?
The homework and Mod 1 Pre-work are designed to push you out of your comfort zone. We are looking to see how you grapple with these concepts and are not as concerned about getting a correct solution. However, if you do get stuck be sure to ask your question in your Mod 0 Slack channel! This will lead to the fastest answers to your questions and will allow everyone to benefit from the question you ask.

However, before asking your question(s) be sure to check out [Asking for Help](https://mod0.turing.edu/asking-questions) section to ensure you are setting yourself up to ask questions that lead to answers!
