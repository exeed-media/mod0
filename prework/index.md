title: Module 1 Pre-work
---

In order to make you as successful as possible during your time here, we have collected readings and exercises for you to complete prior to beginning Mod 1. This pre-work helps provide important context, vocabulary, and baseline of skills to help you hit the ground running on the first day of class. We've found that students who come into the program having invested time in familiarizing themselves with key concepts are able to maximize their time at Turing.

## Mod 1 Pre-work Overview

The Mod 1 Pre-work is divided into three sections: Professional Development, Gear Up, and Technical. It is recommended that you start as soon as possible on your mod 1 pre-work, as it typically takes about 30 - 40 hours to complete. If you finish your mod 1 pre-work early, make sure you continue to code every day after you have completed the assignments, so that your skills don't atrophy. You SHOULD NOT complete the mod 1 pre-work early and take an extended break from coding before your first day of class. This is very important to make sure you are in a routine that will keep your skills sharp and prepare you to hit the ground running on day 1.

### Pre-work Assignments

The following assignments are due based on your mod 0 section and can be found on the [mod 0 calendar]({{ site.baseurl }}/calendar)

The pre-work is made up of 3 parts:
* [Professional Development]({{ site.baseurl }}#professional-dev)
* [Gear Up]({{ site.baseurl }}#gear-up)
* [Technical]({{ site.baseurl }}#technical)

## Professional Development (2 hours)

**Turing is not just a school where you learn to code.** Turing's curriculum focuses on both technical and professional development.

In order to achieve our mission and vision, we also have group sessions each week called Gear Up in order to bring community awareness to certain issues in the tech industry.

The assignments below will be submitted in gists that you will create on your GitHub account. A gist is a text document that can be stored on GitHub. To create a gist, follow the steps below:

* Log in to your GitHub account
* In the upper right corner, click on the '+' icon
* Select 'New Gist'
* Enter a filename, with the extension .md
* Enter the text of your gist in the large text area
* click Create Public Gist
* You can also visit [gist.github.com](https://gist.github.com/)

We take these exercises seriously, and we ask that you do too. We expect at minimum 4-6 sentences in response to **each** question, but feel free to expand and elaborate as you deem necessary. Use Markdown (this is a programming language used for writing) to format your gists.

Use these exercises to start telling your unique story with your distinct experiences. This is something we will continue to practice during your time at Turing.

You can find the professional development assignments [here](https://github.com/turingschool/career-development-curriculum-site/blob/master/module-1-prework/career_development_mod1_prework.md)

Submission instructions for the PD assignment will be listed in the link above.

## Gear Up (2 hours)

Gear up is a part of our curriculum where we talk about topics such as privilege and power, and ethical issues in the tech industry. Here is the [Gear Up Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/pre-work/intro_with_empathy.markdown).

The gear up assignment will be submitted with the technical pre-work. Instructions can be found on day 7 of the technical pre-work.

## Technical Pre-work (Program Specific) (30 - 35 hours)

The technical mod 1 pre-work is split up into 8 days. These days aren't meant to line up with anything, they're only meant to give you an idea of how long each section will take. I'd plan on each one of those days taking about 6 hours on average. Also, keep in mind that the days do get progressively harder and that they build on one another.

At Turing, you will have to code every single day to stay on top of the workload and build muscle memory for everything you've learned. This pre-work is designed to get you into that essential routine before day one of class.

After completing the technical pre-work, you should be able to do the following:

* Be comfortable navigating your development environment and using your tools (Atom, Chrome, the console, and the command line)
* Develop a basic knowledge of Ruby (for back-enders) or JavaScript (for front-enders)

If you have more than 8 days to work on the pre-work, you should break up the work and complete the Next Steps section below so that you are coding every day!

The link below will take you to the Github page that contains all the Technical work. Scroll through the page to find the instructions for getting your computer setup and getting started.

* [Click here to get started with Back-End Technical Mod 1 Pre-work](https://github.com/turingschool/backend_mod_1_prework) (This is your technical mod 1 pre-work if you are in the back-end program)
* [Click here to get started with Front-End Technical Mod 1 Pre-work](https://github.com/turingschool/frontend-mod-1-prework) (This is your technical mod 1 pre-work if you are in the front-end program)

The technical pre-work and gear up pre-work will be submitted in a google survey that is linked on day 7 of the technical pre-work repo for your respective program.

### Next Steps

Before moving any further, complete all of the projects listed in Day 7 of technical pre-work repository.

If you have more time, review the curriculum site for the program that you're joining:
