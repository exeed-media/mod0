## Housekeeping, Wins/Follow-Ups, and Goals

### Wins

- Most common answer to git question from survey: "I can name the steps of the git workflow and can put them in practice (using a reference)."
- This is expected, and we use references as programmers on the job all the time, at some point it'll be muscle memory
- Great job asking and answering each others questions in the slack channel!

### Follow-Ups

- We're in the process of leaving feedback on everyone's homework, be sure to check your gists!
  - Suggestions and feedback are there for your benefit
- Make sure that you're checking Slack at least once a day
- Be sure to stay at your home (root) directory or below

### Psuedocode Practice: Tricky Word Problems

Here is a common code challenge: Write a function that determines whether a given word/string is a palindrome. 

See example below (remember, it is OK if you don't understand exactly what is happening in the code!)

```
"tacocat" >>> returns true
"kitten" >>> returns false
"kayak" >>> returns true
"button" >>> returns false
```

Write pseudocode to explain how you would approach checking whether a given word is a palindrome or not - remember, the smaller you can break up the "steps" the better!

#### 3 minutes - on your own
- How can you break this problem down into smaller chunks or sub-problems?
- What steps are needed to get from the initial data (input) to the desired end result (output)?
- Are there any "edge" cases you need to check?
#### 5 minutes - in groups (finished? start converting to code)
- In groups, take turns sharing your psuedocode
- As a group, come up with a Team Solution that can borrow parts from all the different group members!
#### 10 minutes - Share Outs + Walkthrough

## Basic Data Types + Variable Assignment

In most programming languages, you'll find the same basic <span class="vocab">data types</span>. A data type represents the kind of data that you can use in the programming language. In this section, we'll discuss five different basic data types that are applicable to both the front end and back end. Luckily for us, the <span class="vocab">syntax</span> (the way we write) for these basic data types is almost identical in Ruby and JavaScript.

 
### Data Type Use Cases and Syntax Practice
We are going to break out into program specfiic small groups to start working through these skills!
