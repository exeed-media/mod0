## Mod 0 Technical Assessment Prep

You will be taking the technical assessment following the last session of Mod 0. It is a good idea to begin preparing for this assessment now so that you feel comfortable and confident with the material.

Here are some details about the assessment:
- You will be able to use your notes, online resources, etc. during this assessment - however, there are some timed portions so it is better to prepare than rely solely on these resources!
- A timed multiple choice test - you must get at least an 80% to `PASS` this portion of the assessment
- A coding exercise - you will need to carefully follow directions to create different models of real-world things using objects/hashes - we will cover how to use these data structures in Session 5

#### How Can I Study for This Assessment?

We **STRONGLY** recommend that you study ahead of time for this assessment. Luckily, you've already been "practicing" with many of the exercises and assignments we've had so far in Mod 0. Here are a few other recommendations to best prepare for this assessment:
- Review the your notes, the slides and the online content for each session
  - Ensure you understand the relevant vocabulary and technical content
  - Practice the `You Do` portions with yourself or with other people
- Work in small groups to study and practice the content we've covered, including:
  - Navigating through files using the terminal
  - Basic terminal commands
  - Setting up a repo to track changes using `git`
  - Basic `git` commands
  - How to properly format and write a concise commit message
  - Data types in Javacript (if your in FE program) or Ruby (if you are in BE program)
  - How to assign variables in JavaScript (if your in FE program) or Ruby (if you are in BE program)
  - How to re-assign variables in JavaScript (if your in FE program) or Ruby (if you are in BE program)
  - How to model data using variables
  - How to model data using objects and variables (coming in Session 5)

  Preparing for this assessment is a great way to start building relationships with your community - remember, Turing is NOT a competition! We highly encourage you to use resources such as Slack calls, Zoom meetings, screen sharing, Driver - Navigator, etc. to work with your cohortmates to practice these skills!

## Basic Data Types + Variable Assignment

In most programming languages, you'll find the same basic <span class="vocab">data types</span>. A data type represents the kind of data that you can use in the programming language. In this section, we'll discuss five different basic data types that are applicable to both the front end and back end. Luckily for us, the <span class="vocab">syntax</span> (the way we write) for these basic data types is almost identical in Ruby and JavaScript.

### Data Type Use Cases and Syntax Practice

We are going to break out into program specific groups to start working through these concepts!

- [Backend: Data Types + Variable Assignment in Ruby](./data-types-be.md)
