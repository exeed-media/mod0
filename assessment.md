subheading: Carefully read all instructions below BEFORE starting!

## Directions - READ CAREFULLY BEFORE STARTING!
**This assessment should take you approximately 85 minutes total. Be sure you are in a quiet space, free from distractions before you begin the assessment.**

**The assessment will be broken into two parts - a timed, multiple choice test _and_ a program-specific exerise you will complete on your local machine and push to GitHub.**

### Multiple Choice Test Directions
- You will have 25 minutes to complete a 25-question multiple choice test
- You may use your notes, session slides, online resources, etc. Be careful to keep an eye on the time!
- You must get an 80% or higher to pass this portion of the assessment
- If you do not pass this portion of the assessment, you must repeat Mod 0 before considered ready for promotion to Mod 1

### Program-Specific Exercise
- This exercise should take you no longer than 60 minutes total to complete
- You will be working on your local machine and pushing your changes to a GitHub repo you will create
- If you make an error/typo in one of your commit messages, don't waste time trying to change it - just focus on writing a correct message in your following commits
- Your instructors will review your work after you submit and may ask you to make revisions before you are considered `Turing Ready`
- If your work falls far below expectations, you will likely not have an opportunity to make revisions and instead must repeat Mod 0 before considered ready for promotion to Mod 1

### Assessment Evaluation
After completing the Technical Assessment, your instructors will evaluate your readiness for Mod 1 based on your technical proficiency. They will determine one of three outcomes:
1. Passing Technical Assessment, no revisions required
2. Passing Technical Assessment after a small number of revisions
3. Failing Technical Assessment, requires repeat of Mod 0

As a reminder, the Technical Assessment is only ONE of the data points we use to evaluate readiness for the program. You may still be asked to repeat Mod 0 if you have struggled to show proficiency with professional skills, accountability, interpersonal skills, etc.

**Your instructors will leave feedback directly in your GitHub repository via an `Issue`** - be sure to have notifictions set to receive emails on your GitHub so you will be notified when your feedback has come through and check your email a few days after submitting the Technical Assessment.
