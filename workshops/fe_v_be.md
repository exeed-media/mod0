## "The Stack"

People talk about being back-end, front-end, or full-stack devs, but what does that mean? What technologies are you working in? Where does your code run?

Let's break it down.

At Turing, we teach <span class="vocab">web development</span>. This means that we build applications that live on the internet.

If you're in the **Front-End Program**, you're going to be writing code that lives on the user's computer. For the sake web apps, it'll live within their web browser (ie. chrome). The Front-End is user facing, and can be thought of as the presentation layer. Fun frontend things include data visualization and interesting user interactions. Often, the front-end is referred to as `client side`. 

If you're in the **Back-End Program**, you're likely writing code that lives on a server somewhere. This may not interact with the end user directly. Instead, it's often the back-end's job to store and manipulate data that's sent from the front-end. Or search through data and present it to the front-end. Often, the back-end is referred to as `server side`. 

Front-End and Back-End technologies communicate via a protocol called <span class="vocab">http</span>. This stands for hypertext transfer protocol. Which in simple terms means that it is a standard for how data is sent back and forth over the internet.

#### The stack in practice

<div class="try-it">
  <h3>Try It: Break out rooms</h3> 7 minutes (groups of 3 or 4)
  <p>What happens when we go to `airbnb.com`, and fill out the form with a location and dates, and then click enter?</p>
  <p>What is happening on the front-end/client side?</p>
  <p>What is happening on the back-end/server side?</p>
  <p>In what order?</p>
</div>

#### Technologies

Front-End languages include:

* html
* JavaScript
* css

Does anyone know what front-end technologies are taught at Turing?

Back-End languages include:

* Ruby
* PHP
* Java

Does anyone know what back-end technologies are taught at Turing?


You won't be tested on any of the above, but it's nonetheless great context for what you're going to be learning over the next 7 plus months.
In Mod 0, we'll focus on Ruby and JavaScript as they have the most similarities. And we try to keep things as program agnostic as we can in Mod 0.
