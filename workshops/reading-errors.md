## Error Messages

Error messages are a beautiful thing. Learning how to read errors is very important in programming because they can tell you <em>exactly</em> where you made a mistake.

But error messages can be overwhelming if you're not used to them because they might overload you with information or use terms you don't understand.

What are some strategies that you have already been using to interpret error messages?

  <h3>Mythical Creatures: A Primer</h3>
  <p>Everyone should do a fist to five to show their comfort with error messages. Whoever is the least comfortable with errors will share their screen. Whoever is sharing their screen will be the driver. Every other person in the room will be a navigator.</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Clone and cd into the repo:</li>
      <ul>
        <li><a href="https://github.com/corneliusellen/mythical-creatures-primer-fe">Frontend version</a></li>
        <li><a href="https://github.com/corneliusellen/mythical-creatures-primer">Backend version</a></li>
      </ul>
      <li>Run the file with the command <code>ruby yeti.rb</code> for BE or <code>node yeti.rb</code> for FE.</li>
      <li>Discuss with your group what you think the error message means.</li>
      <li>Fix the error.</li>
      <li>Repeat step 2-4 until there are no more errors. You will know you are making progress if the error messages change.</li>
    </ol>

  <p>You've corrected all the errors when you see the single line <code>We'll have to outwit the Bumble with our superior intelligence</code> outputted to your terminal.</p>

  <p><b>Note: To fix the errors, you shouldn't just delete entire lines of code. Only update lines or add them.</b></p>
