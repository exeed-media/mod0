To come ready to your live class on Methods ready to engage, please complete the following:

1. Brush up on Data Types: You should be able to quickly and accurately identify a String, Integer, Float, and Boolean when presented with one. If you are struggling with this, or unsure of how fluent you are, ask a classmate to quiz you, create flashcards for yourself, or use another strategy that works for you.
2. [Using this list of Methods for Integers and Floats](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/ruby-number-methods-integer-and-float-methods-with-examples/), explore some of those that interest you!
  - "Play around" with some of the code you see ("play around" meaning, type or copy-and-paste and run in your code editor. Modify it, then run again, to observe the change in output)
  - Attempt to write 1-2 sentences for a couple methods of your choice, explaining clearly what they do. 
  - What does `#=>` mean in the code snippets?
