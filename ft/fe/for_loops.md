title: For Loops
---

## Learning Goals

- Explain the concept of looping over an Array
- Implement syntax for `for loops` for a variety of situations

## Vocabulary

- <span class="vocab">for loop</span>

## Warm Up

<!-- TO DO: Add vocab activity with array - element, index, et -->

## `for loop`

<!-- TO DO: Discovery Activity -->
<!-- TO DO: THEN Stamp concept -->

## Predict What Will Happen

<!-- Some You Do Activities, practice explaining what is happening in BO rooms -->

## Practice

Use a `for` loop to solve each problem. You can do this work in the place that works best for you - Dev Tools Console, a file in Atom, or an online editor.

<div class="s-card">
  <p>Print out a greeting to each friend:</p>
  <p><code>friends = ["Joe", "Jeff", "Alex", "Justina"]</code></p>
</div>
<br>

<div class="s-card">
  <p>Find the square of each number:</p>
  <p><code>numbers = [2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12]</code></p>
</div>
<br>

<div class="s-card">
  <p>Print out each String, but capitalize the first character of each String:</p>
  <p><code>words = ["sunny", "beach", "waves", "relax"]</code></p>
</div>
<br>

<div class="s-card">
  <p>Print out numbers that are greater than 10:</p>
  <p><code>numbers = [10, 11, 7, 19, 4, 52, 89, 9, 12, 10]</code></p>
</div>
<br>

<div class="s-card">
  <p>Challenge: Print out only names that begin with "P":</p>
  <p><code>names = ["Pilar", "Petunia", "Pamela", "Tan", "Amanda", "Phil"]</code></p>
</div>
<br>
