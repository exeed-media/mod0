title: Mod 0 Project
---

In order to make you as successful as possible during your time here, we have collected readings and exercises for you to complete prior to beginning Mod 1. This pre-work helps provide important context, vocabulary, and baseline of skills to help you hit the ground running on the first day of class. We've found that students who come into the program having invested time in familiarizing themselves with key concepts are able to maximize their time at Turing.

## Mod 0 Project Overview

The Mod 0 Project typically takes about **35 hours to complete**. Careful time management will be necessary for you to complete this work by the deadline. The deadline canbe found on the Mod 0 Calendar.

The project involves both technical work as well as some professional development work. The expectation is that ALL sections are complete, and submitted by the deadline. This is a requirement to start Mod 1.

>**Do NOT work on your project within GitHub's interface** - This project was intentionally built in a way that requires you to use your tools, two of which are Git and GitHub. Also, if you are working directly in GitHub's interface to edit your work, you will likely run into some issues keeping your work in sync.
