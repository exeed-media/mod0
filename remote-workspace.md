This may be your first time learning and/or working in a remote setting. There are a few key tools we recommend to set yourself up for success as a remote student.

We **STRONGLY RECOMMEND** acquiring everything in the `NEED TO HAVE` list and building your workspace before you start Mod 0 so you can feel comfortable and prepared.

## NEED TO HAVE 

### External Monitor/Display

Most developers do not just rely on their laptop display for their work environment, instead relying on an additional monitor to allow for more "screen real estate." In fact, our instructors find that students without a second screen are at a disadvantage or work more slowly.

Benefits of having a second external monitor include:
- More easily organize your workspace
- Have a browser open as you code for Google, documentation, project specifications, etc.
- See visual changes in real-time as you change code

Luckily, an external monitor can be acquired fairly inexpensively. For the purposes of Turing and software development you do NOT need a top-of-the-line monitor that emphasizes graphics, pixels, etc.

Here are a few of our recommendations...

#### Monitors Under $100

There are plenty of great used options available on eBay, Facebook Marketplace, Craigslist, etc. All you really need is something that fits in your workspace and can connect to your MacBook!

Another great option is to post in the `#turing-craigslist` channel in Slack! A member of the community might have an affordable monitor laying around that you could use.


#### Monitors Under $200

Check out [Amazon computer monitors priced between $100-200](https://www.amazon.com/s?bbn=1292115011&rh=n%3A1292115011%2Cp_36%3A1253506011&dc&qid=1639941466&rnid=386442011&ref=lp_1292115011_nr_p_36_3).

If this link doesn't work, search 'computer monitors' on Amazon, Best Buy, or any similar retailer. Filter by price. Read reviews and specs to ensure the monitor is compatible with your MacBook.

If you are unable to acquire an external monitor prior to Mod 1, please DM the Mod 0 Lead on Slack and we can discuss other options.

#### Connecting to Your Monitor

You will need to ensure that you can connect your MacBook to your external monitor/display. To do so, you will need a [USB-C to HDMI cable](https://www.amazon.com/uni-Thunderbolt-Compatible-MacBook-Surface/dp/B075V5JK36/ref=sr_1_4_mod_primary_lightning_deal?dchild=1&keywords=HDMI+to+USBC&qid=1614621192&s=electronics&sbo=Tc8eqSFhUl4VwMzbE4fw%2Fw%3D%3D&smid=A38T47GEW176IO&sr=1-4) - these can usually be purchased for less than $15.  

### Dedicated Workspace

It is crucial to have a workspace that satisfies a few basic requirements...
1. Access to reliable internet connection
1. A place that is quiet and free from distractions
1. A place that is big enough for your laptop, monitor, and a notebook
1. A place where you can participate in video calls, conversations, etc. 

Take time before Mod 0 to build your workspace and experiment with different setups until you find a configuration that works for you.

### Notebook + Writing Utensils

While you will be working on your laptop while you code, work on projects, etc., we recommend using a physical notebook to take notes during class and workshops. You will learn about different notetaking strategies for learning technical content; in the meantime, we also recommend getting a set of colored pens/markers/pencils for your notebook. This will make it easier to diagram and write code syntax, which you will learn more about in Mod 0!

Notebook size/style are a personal preference thing, just be sure to give yourself enough space/pages to take good notes, including diagrams and drawings! Many of our students will create a dedicated notebook for each module so be on the lookout for some 4-packs.

## NICE TO HAVE

If you are looking for other ideas for ways to improve your workspace, here are a few more recommendations. These are **NOT REQUIRED** by any means, but some of our students have found success using these other supplies. 

### Headphones with Microphone

Since you'll be on a lot of video calls and collaborating remotely, having a good set of headphones and a decent microphone can improve your experience. While your Turing issued laptop has built-in speakers and a microphone, if your workspace has a lot of ambient noise, we strongly encourage you to invest in headphones + microphone. 

### Water Bottle

HYDRATE. HYDRATE. HYDRATE.

### USB-C Hub

Your Turing issued laptop only has 2 ports. You'll need one for your charger and one for your external monitor. If you require more ports, [these USB-C hubs](https://www.amazon.com/Hiearcool-MacBook-Multiport-Compatible-Nintendo/dp/B07WPTG7NX/ref=sr_1_1_sspa?crid=87I337CM3VZM&dchild=1&keywords=usb+c+hub&qid=1614621164&s=electronics&sprefix=usb+c%2Celectronics%2C227&sr=1-1-spons&psc=1&spLa=ZW5jcnlwdGVkUXVhbGlmaWVyPUEyRE9CQ0FMR1NKVE9HJmVuY3J5cHRlZElkPUEwNTgxMDk0UzlJNkRQRjJEVlMzJmVuY3J5cHRlZEFkSWQ9QTA1MzU1MjAzR0JWNjdBUENLNDVPJndpZGdldE5hbWU9c3BfYXRmJmFjdGlvbj1jbGlja1JlZGlyZWN0JmRvTm90TG9nQ2xpY2s9dHJ1ZQ==) are great!

### External Keyboard

Some folks are more picky with their keyboards and prefer a certain look, feel, touch, etc. If you are one of these people, you may benefit from using a different keyboard than the integrated one in your laptop. If you plan to use a wired keyboard, you'll likely need the USB-C hub mentioned above to connect to your keyboard in addition to your charger and monitor.

### Laptop Stand

These can be useful when using a separate keyboard or for creating more real estate for your workspace.

### Blue Light Filtering Glasses/Apps

You'll be staring at your computer screens a lot over the course of your journey. There are a lot of [products](https://smile.amazon.com/s?k=blue+light+glasses&crid=8R6PG96S9O1&sprefix=blue+l%2Caps%2C218&ref=nb_sb_ss_midas-iss-sm_1_6) and [apps](https://justgetflux.com/) on the market to help mitigate the effects of looking at blue-light emitting screens for long periods of time.

### Other Really NICE TO HAVE's

- Pets
- Healthy snacks
- Access to fresh air
