### Time Management at Turing
As you may have heard, the time commitment at Turing is no joke. In case you HAVEN'T heard, let's just get it out in the open: many students work harder at Turing than they have ever worked before. Remember, this is an accelerated program - you are going to learn the technical and professional skills needed to succeed in demanding, yet high-paying technical careers in only 7ish months!

Most students estimate they work an **average of 60 hours per week** at Turing- some weeks with fewer hours, some weeks with more hours. While at Turing, **time** is your most valuable commodity-  how you use your time will go a long way in determining your overall success in the program! And ask any student: time has a way of escaping you at Turing unless you are able to manage it successfully.

One strategy we've seen our most successful students employ is using some type of calendar system to track, manage and plan their time while in the program. A few key notes:
- Calendaring is a very difficult skill to master - you will need to commit to practicing it in order to improve!
- Everyone's system, calendar tool, etc. might be a little different, but those who DON'T use any tool typically struggle with time management while at Turing
- Calendar's are meant to be living documents that can change - unfortunately you can't plan for everything!
- Managing your time becomes more important as the program progresses and you are balancing the technical curriculum with searching for your first software developer job! 

#### Calendar Analysis - Small Groups
In small groups, take a look at the following [calendar examples](https://gist.github.com/ericweissman/6c4e0d9b658e0014b981093be8694288). 

Be sure to discuss the following AND jot down your own observations in your notebooks.

- What stands out about this calendar?
- Are there any potential issues with this calendar?
- Are there any aspects of this calendar you would want to include on your own?


After discussing in groups, we will share out observations as a whole!

#### Calendar Tips from Successful Students
A few helpful tips to building a strong calendar...
- Color coding your calendar can give you a quick snapshot of how you are allocating your time
- Purposefully build in scheduled time for health, wellness and whatever else you need to be your best self! If you don't plan for it - chances are it won't happen
- Turing moves fast, but it is still a marathon. How can you make sure you are creating a sustainable schedule/routine?
- Build in time each week to reflect on how well you stuck to your schedule. Be graceous to yourself and adjust the upcoming week
- Avoid context shifting too frequently - this can be extremely exhausting! It is better to have dedicated blocks of time for particular tasks as opposed to focusing on a bunch of separate tasks within one block of time
