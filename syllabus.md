## Mod 0 Dates

- For students in the 2207 cohort: June 6-10
- For students in the 2208 cohort: August 1-5
- For students in the 2210 cohort: September 19-23

## Slack

Staff will use the cohort Slack channel as the primary means of communication with students.

## Time Commitment

Students should expect to spend about 30 hours/week while in Mod 0 - this includes attending live sessions, completing homework, self-paced work on the project, and checking Slack daily. Taking this course while working a full-time (~40 hours/week) job is a great way for students to get an understanding of a realistic week, in regards to timing and scheduling challenges.

## Attendance

Students are expected to attend all scheduled live sessions, on time. Staff will work on a case by case basis with students who communicate any prior commitments or have emergencies arise.

## Homework Submissions

Students must complete and submit all homework assignments, on time. The assignments can be found in the Trello board.

## Mod 0 Project

Students must complete and submit the Mod 0 project, on time. Most students spend 35-40 hours on it in total, so it is recommended students map our a plan on their calendar to pace themselves towards completion over the 2-3 weeks of Mod 0.

## Feedback

Students will be provided feedback throughout the week. It is expected that students implement feedback provided by staff - sometimes this will mean revising submissions, sometimes they will just need to implement it in future assignments.
