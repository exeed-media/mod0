## Slack

Staff will use the cohort Slack channel as the primary means of communication with students.

## Time Commitment

**_Classic:_** Students should expect to spend about 18-20 hours/week while in Mod 0 - this includes attending live sessions, completing  self-paced work, and checking Slack daily. Students will be expected to join a zoom call at least 5 times throughout the course in the evenings from 6-8pm MT. Taking this course while working a full-time (~40 hours/week) job is a great way for students to get an understanding of a realistic week, in regards to timing and scheduling challenges.

**_Intensive:_** Students will be expected to join a zoom call every morning from approximately 8-9am MT. A handful of other live sessions will be placed on the calendar, schedule will vary based, but students should plan to work for about 10-12 hours/day each day of the week. Students should not have any other work commitments or responsibilities while taking this course.

## Attendance

Students are expected to attend all scheduled live sessions, on time. Staff will work on a case-by-case basis with students who communicate any prior commitments or have emergencies arise. If a student must miss a live session, it is the student's responsibility to proactively let staff know, and make a plan for how they will make up for any content missed. 

## Work Submissions

Throughout the course, students will submit many assignments. Work should be completed and submitted via the provided submission form, within the timeline outlined by staff. All assignments can be found in the Trello board for your assigned Mod 0 Format and Program. In the event a student gets behind and needs an extension and/or support to adjust schedules to get back on track, it is the student's responsibility to proactively reach out and discuss what that could look like. These assignments are the student's opportunity to demonstrate they are progressing through the content and will be successful in Mod 1.

## Evaluations

The final check for readiness is in the form of a Live Paired Evaluation. Each student will be paired with another student and a staff member will facilitate a 30-minute evaluation for that pair. During that time, the pair will receive a code challenge and work collaboratively to solve it. Feedback [based on the evaluation rubric](https://turingschool.notion.site/turingschool/9d22c7265b4e4d75a994496605ec8e94?v=3232bf7092914bb998b63b3f12c9be62) will be provided either live on the call, live on a separate call, or via Slack DM. You can read more about the evaluations process [here](https://mod0.turing.edu/shared/shared/evals).

## Feedback

Students will be provided feedback throughout the course. It is expected that students implement feedback provided by staff - sometimes this will mean revising submissions, sometimes they will just need to implement it in future assignments. Students should also take it upon themselves to frequently self-evaluate and tools will be provided to support students in strengthening their ability to self-evaluate.
