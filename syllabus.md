## Slack

Staff will use the cohort Slack channel as the primary means of communication with students. As an incoming student, it's important to be armed with information - and if you don't find the information you need - to know where to go for it. All Turing staff members use Slack as our main method of communication.

## Time Commitment

**_Classic:_** Students should expect to spend about 18-20 hours/week while in Mod 0 - this includes attending live sessions, completing  self-paced work, and checking Slack daily. Students will be expected to join a zoom call at least 5 times throughout the course in the evenings from 6-8pm MT. Taking this course while working a full-time (~40 hours/week) job is a great way for students to get an understanding of a realistic week, in regards to timing and scheduling challenges.

**_Intensive:_** Students are expected to join a zoom call every morning from approximately 9-10am MT. A handful of other live sessions will be placed on the calendar, schedule will vary based, but students should plan to work for about 10-12 hours/day each day of the week. Students should not have any other work commitments or responsibilities while taking this course.

## Attendance

Students are expected to attend all scheduled live sessions, on time. Staff will work on a case-by-case basis with students who communicate any prior commitments or have emergencies arise. If a student must miss a live session, it is the student's responsibility to proactively let staff know, and make a plan for how they will make up for any content missed. 

## Work Submissions

Throughout the course, students will submit many assignments. Work should be completed and submitted via the provided submission form, within the timeline outlined by staff. All assignments can be found in the Trello board for your assigned Mod 0 Format and Program. In the event a student gets behind and needs an extension and/or support to adjust schedules to get back on track, it is the student's responsibility to proactively reach out and discuss what that could look like. These assignments are the student's opportunity to demonstrate they are progressing through the content and will be successful in Mod 1.

## Evaluations

The final check for readiness is in the form of a Live Paired Evaluation. Each student will be paired with another student and a staff member will facilitate a 30-minute evaluation for that pair. During that time, the pair will receive a code challenge and work collaboratively to solve it. Feedback [based on the evaluation rubric](https://turingschool.notion.site/turingschool/9d22c7265b4e4d75a994496605ec8e94?v=3232bf7092914bb998b63b3f12c9be62) will be provided either live on the call, live on a separate call, or via Slack DM. You can read more about the evaluations process [here](https://mod0.turing.edu/shared/shared/evals).

## Feedback

Students will be provided feedback throughout the course. It is expected that students implement feedback provided by staff - sometimes this will mean revising submissions, sometimes they will just need to implement it in future assignments. Students should also take it upon themselves to frequently self-evaluate and tools will be provided to support students in strengthening their ability to self-evaluate.

## Computer Setup Challenges

As stated in communications leading up to your Mod 0 start date, some time spent setting up your Turing-issued computer is required before attending your first session. If you experience any difficulties after carefully following the directions, please _post those concerns in your Mod 0 Slack channel_. Your difficulty may be something students frequently encounter, so posting it publicly allows more people to help you and may also benefit others if they experience the same thing. If it is a very unique situation, an instructor will follow-up individually.

Again, it is essential that your computer is set up for the first day of Mod 0, so reach out proactively - well _before_ the day of your first session!

## Technical Questions

As a Mod 0 student, you'll be attending classes, previewing and reviewing lessons, and completing self-paced work throughout. Even though the main focus of Mod 0 is to support you in having the tools, habits, and mindsets necessary for success in Mod 1, you will do some technical work. It is inevitable that questions will come up, and that's a good thing! 

>Your Mod 0 Slack channel is the first place you should ask technical questions.

Posting questions there increases collaboration - opportunities to get various perspectives on your question as well as benefitting others who may have the same question. For that reason, instructors will not answer technical questions via DMs.

## Enrollment Questions

In order to secure a seat as a student at Turing, one must complete all the registration paperwork (including uploading HS Transcripts _and_ getting them approved) and pay their deposit. **If you have any questions regarding your status with those items or your start dates, please first check your Populi account.** If you still have questions or need to make a change to your enrollment status, please contact _Launa Gardner_ on Slack.

## Tuition Questions

If you are enrolled in Mod 0, that means you've paid your deposit. The remainder of your tuition is due 30 days prior to your Mod 1 start date. Turing does provides financial counseling, however, it is _the student's_ responsibility to take advantage of that resource if needed, and that should be done well in advance of the tuition deadline as exceptions will not be made. To set up a financial counseling session or ask clarifying questions about your tuition, please email financialaid@turing.edu.


**Before your first Mod 0 session**, we ask that you complete the following tasks to familiarize yourself with the tools we use and ensure that you are set up to be successful.

**PLEASE PLAN TO SPEND ABOUT 4 HOURS ON THESE TASKS!**

## Read Course Syllabus, Calendar

Navigate to the main page of this site and locate the Syllabus and Calendar pages, both linked in the main navigation bar. Read them each carefully and make sure you understand the expectations for Mod 0, including the dates.

## Complete the Computer Setup

It is **essential** that you set up your computer according to the instructions outlined in the [Computer Setup]({{ site.baseurl }}/computer-setup). On occasion, students run into problems installing some of the programs, so it is advised you start this sooner than later in the event you need to reach out for support on Slack.

## Remote Workspace

Read this guide on [how to prepare your supplies and workspace]({{ sitebaseurl }}/remote-workspace). Take any actions steps necessary to prepare yourself for remote learning.

## Notetaking

Many of you are entering an academic setting for the first time in many years. Your experience at Turing will likely be much different than your previous academic experiences! We will use Mod 0 to start preparing you for the expectations at Turing, so that you can start learning technical content on the first day of Mod 1.

One area instructors have reported students that struggle with is **how** and **when** to take notes, especially when it comes to technical content. [This guide provides some exemplar note taking strategies as well as some tips and tricks.](https://gist.github.com/ericweissman/a729a849ed6355ed8ee0c9156a8e9c98)

## Read Thoughts on Professionalism

Read [these reflections](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1LNyXge4p6OQTWbo_Y9XIJAF2LEwNnN4P/view) from a former student and take notes on the following:
1. What stood out to you as you read this?
1. What surprised you after reading this?
1. How will this impact your approach to Mod 0?

## Prep Sharing Your "Why"

During the first session of Mod 0, you will break out into small groups and be asked to each share your "why" for taking this step to change careers, and your life. Spend some time reflecting on what is motiavting you most to be here, and how to communicate that best to your peers so they start to understand you and what drives you. Be prepared to share that with the group in 1-2 minutes.
