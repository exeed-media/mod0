## Slack

Staff will use the cohort Slack channel as the primary means of communication with students.

## Time Commitment

**_Part Time:_** Students should expect to spend about 30 hours/week while in Mod 0 - this includes attending live sessions, completing homework, self-paced work on the project, and checking Slack daily. Taking this course while working a full-time (~40 hours/week) job is a great way for students to get an understanding of a realistic week, in regards to timing and scheduling challenges.

**_Full Time:_** Students will be expected to join a zoom every morning from approximately 8-9am MT. A handful of other live sessions will be placed on the calendar, schedule will vary based, but students should plan to work for about 10 hours/day each day of the week. Students should not have any other work commitments or responsibilities while taking this course.

## Attendance

Students are expected to attend all scheduled live sessions, on time. Staff will work on a case by case basis with students who communicate any prior commitments or have emergencies arise. If a student must miss a live session, it is the students responsibility to proactively let staff know, and make a plan for how they will make up for any content missed. 

## Work Submissions

**_Part Time:_** Students must complete and submit all homework assignments, on time. The assignments can be found in the Trello board. Students must complete and submit the Mod 0 Project, on time. Most students spend 35-40 hours on it in total, so it is recommended students map our a plan on their calendar to pace themselves towards completion over the 2-3 weeks of Mod 0.

**_Full Time:_** Throughout the course, students will submit many pieces of work. Work should be completed and submitted via the provided submission forms, within the timeline outlined by staff. In the event a student gets behind and needs an extension and/or support to adjust schedules to get back on track, it it the students responsibility to proactively reach out and discuss what that could look like. This body of work is a large part of a students opportunity to demonstrate they are progressing through the content and will be able to be successful in Mod 1.

## Evaluations

**_Full Time only:_** The final check for readiness is in the form of a Live Paired Evaluation. Each student will be paired with another student. A staff member will facilitate a 30 minute evaluation for that pair. During that time, the pair will receive a code challenge and work collaboratively to solve it. Feedback [based on the evaluation rubric](https://turingschool.notion.site/Live-Paired-Eval-610dc657479b4cdfaabdfbee4c9d4255) will be provided either live on the call, live on a separate call, or oer Slack DM.

## Feedback

Students will be provided feedback throughout the course. It is expected that students implement feedback provided by staff - sometimes this will mean revising submissions, sometimes they will just need to implement it in future assignments. Students should also take it upon themselves to frequently self-evaluate; tools will be provided to support students in strengthening their ability to self-evaluate.
