## Before Starting Mod 0...
We are glad to have you join us for Mod 0! 

**Before your first session**, we ask that you complete the following tasks to familiarize yourself with the tools we use on a regular basis and ensure that you are set up to be successful.

**PLEASE PLAN TO SPEND 2.5-3 HOURS ON THESE TASKS!**

### Watch the Mod 0 Orientation Video

Turing staff members talk about what to expect at Turing and how to be successful here.

### Complete the Turing Computer Setup
It is critical that you set up your computer according to the instructions outlined in the Computer Setup! You can access the Computer Setup instructions on the left sidebar any time or [click here](https://mod0.turing.io/setup-instructions)! 

### Zoom Setup + Housekeeping
Since Turing is a remote school, we will use Zoom for our video conferencing software for class, group projects, etc.
- Sign up for [Zoom](zoom.us)
- Update your name in [your profile](https://support.zoom.us/hc/en-us/articles/201363203-My-Profile) following this pattern: First Name, Last Initial, Preferred Pronouns, Program - `Eric W (he/him), FE`
- Learn how to [raise your hand](https://support.zoom.us/hc/en-us/articles/205566129-Raise-Hand-In-Webinar)
- Give your Zoom account screen sharing permission and microphone permission
- **BONUS**: Learn keyboard shortcut for using Emoji in MacOS

### Slack
Slack is our main communication tool at Turing. You will receive an invite to join the Turing Slack a few days before you are scheduled to start your Mod 0 session. To ensure that you are prepared for your first session...
- Watch the [Slack Tutorial Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfq333EpWgM)
- Join your specific `mod-0` channel (check email for invite)
- Upload a clear and appropriate Headshot for your Profile image
- Set up your Slack profile
- Practice the following skills AND take notes on how to perform them in your notebook!
  - How to start a thread
  - How to reply in a thread
  - How to format an `inline code example`
  - How to create a larger code snippet, like such:
    ```
      You can create multi-line
      code snippets in Slack
      That make it easier to share larger blocks of code
    ```
- Join additional channels according to your interests! A few we recommend are:
- #salaries
- #announcements
- #broadcast

### FE vs BE Activity
While you likely have picked your track for Turing, it's still critical to understand how front-end and back-end works together!

- Watch [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7CjChB48_oM&feature=youtu.be)
- Stop the video when prompted and take notes on the following:
  - What do you think is happening on the front-end?
  What do you think is happening on the back-end?
