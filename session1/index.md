* Sessions will be recorded and posted in Slack
* No computer yet? Don't fret for today. If you don't have a mac, please reach out to me! (Eric Weissman or @ericweissman)

### Breakout Rooms

This is a feature in zoom that we'll use throughout the mod 0 sessions. They allow for small group discussion, where y'all can solidify concepts or work through challenges. You'll be kicked out into smaller group with 2 or 3 of your classmates. When they're finished you'll get a 30 second warning where you can rejoin the main session, or you'll automatically rejoin at the end of the 30 seconds. During these, we may broadcast messages or pop in to see how we are doing time-wise.

Some norms before heading in:
* Be aware and try not talk over others.
* Leave space and time for everyone to share.

Breakout groups can be a bit awkward at first, but try to embrace them and have fun!

<div class="try-it">
  <h3>Try It: Break out rooms</h3> 5 minutes (groups of 3 or 4)
  <p>1. Introduce yourself (name, pronouns, program)</p>
  <p>2. Where do you call home</p>
  <p>3. What were your takeaways from the orientation video that you watched in preparation for class?</p>
  <p>4. Done? What questions do you still have?</p>
</div>

Other things to note as we go through Mod 0:

- <strong>Zoom</strong>: turn video on, turn mic off unless speaking
- <strong>You can raise your hand using zoom</strong>: go ahead and try it now!
- <strong>Problems or individual questions during the Zoom session?</strong> Send a message in the chat!

## Mythbusting @ Turing
#### Myth 1 - The "Lone Wolf" Approach
We've met many propspective students who think that they can succeed at Turing (and in programming) by doing things alone. If you've said to yourself, "I'm just going to do my thing and the only reason I'm here is to learn to code..." you should probably chose a different program.

Turing and software development is inherently collaborative. Our project-based learning approach requires teammwork, collaboration and making sacrifices. If you want to only focus on "coding", it's probably best to just choose another program or learn on your own. Good luck getting a job, though!

#### Myth 2- "FE is harder! No - BE is harder!"
Reality check - both frontend development and backend development are "hard". That is why salaries are high for positions in this field! At Turing, you will get exposure to the "full stack" - in fact, your final module will be a combined cohort of frontend and backend students! 

#### Myth 3 - People "fail" Turing due to the technical content
Believe it or not, 99% of failing projects at Turing have little to do with technical deficits. Instead, poor communication and issues with collaboration are the main cause of failitheng projects. Remember, your Turing experience is designed to prepare you for the actual job - collaborating and communicating under tight deadlines is what makes the job difficult!  -->

## Setup for Success: Notetaking x Technical Content
Many of you are diving back into an academic setting for the first time in awhile. To be clear, the Turing experience is likely MUCH different than your previous academic experiecnes! We will use Mod 0 to start preparing you to kick ass at Turing and start your transformation into a developer off on the right foot.

One area we notice students struggle with is how and when to take notes. Before we go into specifics, take a look at [these notes](https://gist.github.com/ericweissman/a729a849ed6355ed8ee0c9156a8e9c98) created by some of our most successful students.

- What things stand out as your look at these examples?
- How do these examples compare to your current notes?

<a name="notetaking"></a>

#### Tips for Strong Notetaking @ Turing
- **Setup is a key to success:** Having an organization strategy can make it easier to use your notes as a tool. We recommend creating a `Table of Contents ` to make it easier to reference your notes. Also, taking notes on key vocabulary BEFORE a lesson has been useful for some students!
- **Use different colors:** This can help with modeling syntax highlighting, making notes easier to read, draw attention to different content
- **Leave plenty of whitespace:** Allows you to add more context, write questions, make connections
- **Draw or diagram often:** Many concepts can be difficult to understand with just words, use drawings/diagrams to help synthesize and frame information
- **Pen + Paper > Digital:** Don't rely on taking notes on your computer. Studies have proven that you will retain more information by physically writing your notes. Plus, it will make diagramming and drawing easier! 
 
## Time Management at Turing
As you may have heard, the time commitment at Turing is no joke. In case you HAVEN'T heard, let's just get it out in the open: many students work harder at Turing than they have ever worked before. Remember, this is an accelerated program - you are going to learn the technical and professional skills needed to succeed in demanding, yet high-paying technical careers in only 7ish months!

Most students estimate they work an **average of 60 hours per week** at Turing- some weeks with fewer hours, some weeks with more hours. While at Turing, **time** is your most valuable commodity-  how you use your time will go a long way in determining your overall success in the program! And ask any student: time has a way of escaping you at Turing unless you are able to manage it successfully.

One strategy we've seen our most successful students employ is using some type of calendar system to track, manage and plan their time while in the program. A few key notes:
- Calendaring is a very difficult skill to master - you will need to commit to practicing it in order to improve!
- Everyone's system, calendar tool, etc. might be a little different, but those who DON'T use any tool typically struggle with time management while at Turing
- Calendar's are meant to be living documents that can change - unfortunately you can't plan for everything!
- Managing your time becomes more important as the program progresses and you are balancing the technical curriculum with searching for your first software developer job! 

#### Calendar Analysis - Small Groups
In small groups, take a look at the following [calendar examples](https://gist.github.com/ericweissman/6c4e0d9b658e0014b981093be8694288). 

Be sure to discuss the following AND jot down your own observations in your notebooks.

- What stands out about this calendar?
- Are there any potential issues with this calendar?
- Are there any aspects of this calendar you would want to include on your own?


After discussing in groups, we will share out observations as a whole!

#### Calendar Tips from Successful Students
A few helpful tips to building a strong calendar...
- Color coding your calendar can give you a quick snapshot of how you are allocating your time
- Purposefully build in scheduled time for health, wellness and whatever else you need to be your best self! If you don't plan for it - chances are it won't happen
- Turing moves fast, but it is still a marathon. How can you make sure you are creating a sustainable schedule/routine?
- Build in time each week to reflect on how well you stuck to your schedule. Be graceous to yourself and adjust the upcoming week
- Avoid context shifting too frequently - this can be extremely exhausting! It is better to have dedicated blocks of time for particular tasks as opposed to focusing on a bunch of separate tasks within one block of time


## BREAK 

Turn off your mics and videos and walk away from the computer. Stand up, stretch, drink water. Do a few sit-ups, squats, push-ups, jumping jacks, arm circles, stress ball squeezes, or whatever else moves your body.

<a name="findinganswers"></a>
## Googling

Believe it or not, a good chunk of your time as a programmer will be spent Googling to find answers to your questions. In fact, a somewhat experienced programmer will Google at a much higher rate than a beginning programmer. Therefore, it's really important to get good at Googling.

For a frame of reference so that you know just how often we rely on Google (even the "easy" stuff), this is my most recent Chrome history as I've been building this curriculum ðŸ˜‚

<img style="width: 50%" src="images/rachel_history.png" alt="Rachel's search history">

When I Google programming questions, I _usually_ include three things (in varying orders):

- What I want to do (verb)
- to what thing (noun)
- using what language or tool

For example, if I wanted to add a thick green border to a heading on my webpage and I'm using plain CSS for styling, I might google this:

```
how to add border to heading css
```

or

```
make border on heading element css
```
***SUPER IMPORTANT:*** You might not get the results you're looking for on the first go-around.

## Files, Directories, and Paths

On your computer, you probably have many <span class="vocab">files</span> and <span class="vocab">directories</span>. Files are things like text documents, images, videos, PDFs, etc. Directories (or folders) are the structures we use to organize these files.

In the diagram below, we would say that there's a directory called `essays` that contains three files: `life_lessons.docx`, `book_report.docx`, and `literary_analysis.docx`:

<hr>
<h4>Example #1</h4>
<div class="flex-container">
  <div>
    <img src="images/files_directories_1.png" alt="files and directories 1">
  </div>
  <div>
    A <span class="vocab">file path</span> is a way to notate where a file "lives" on your computer. This is the structure:
    <pre>directory_name/file_name.extension</pre>
    The file path for the first file in the diagram would be:
    <pre>essays/life_lessons.docx</pre>
    <p>What is the path for book_report.docx?</p>
    <textarea rows="1" name="" style="width:100%;"></textarea>
    <p>What is the path for literary_analysis.docx?</p>
    <textarea rows="1" name="" style="width:100%;"></textarea>
  </div>
</div>
<div class="things-to-note">
  <h4>Things to Note</h4>
  <ol>
    <li>A file cannot be inside of another file. This means that every part of the path <strong>before</strong> the actual file is a directory. </li>
    <li>For now, we will follow two convention rules: </li>
    <ul>
      <li>Use lower case letters when naming directories and files</li>
      <li>Use underscores (_) or hyphens (-) instead of spaces when naming directories and files. However, keep in mind that different languages and frameworks have different conventions. Rather than arguing over which approach is "correct" (you'll find a lot of this on the internet), it is more important to pick an approach and be consistent. For today's lesson, we'll use the underscore (_) approach.</li>
    </ul>
    <li>Folders do not have extensions (like <strong>.docx</strong> or <strong>.md</strong> or <strong>.csv</strong>, etc.) but file names do have extensions.</li>
    <li>File extensions matter. A <strong>.md</strong> file will behave differently than a <strong>.docx</strong> file, which will also behave differently than a <strong>.md</strong> file because the extensions help the operating system figure out which application can open the file. </li>
  </ol>
</div>
<hr>
<h4>Example #2</h4>
<div class="flex-container">

       We commonly refer to directories with an analogy of <span class="vocab">parent</span> and <span class="vocab">child</span>. In the above example <code>to_do</code> is the <span class="vocab">parent</span> directory of the <code>home</code> and <code>work</code> directories. <code>projects_to_delegate</code> is a <span class="vocab">child</span> directory of the <code>work</code> directory.
    </li>
  </ol>
</div>

## BREAK 

Turn off your mics and videos and walk away from the computer. Stand up, stretch, drink water. Do a few sit-ups, squats, push-ups, jumping jacks, arm circles, stress ball squeezes, or whatever else moves your body.

<hr>
<a name="terminalcommandline"></a>
## Terminal and Command Line

The <span class="vocab">terminal</span> is what we call a command line interface. Basically, that's a fancy way of saying that it's the program we use to give commands to the computer.

We use the command line because it is a faster and more precise way to navigate our file systems, and certain tools can only be downloaded and accessed via the command line.

Your terminal will look something like this:

<img src="images/david_terminal.png" alt="">

<a name="profiledetour"></a>
**Apple recently changed its default profile to .zsh.**
We will be using zsh in Mod-0 and beyond. Another <span class="vocab">shell</span> you may hear about is called bash. These shells mostly behave the same. You will learn how to start customizing your zsh shell as part of your HW!

Some follow up reading that is **Not Required**: [Apple Switches from .bash to .zsh - who cares and what does that even mean?](https://scriptingosx.com/2019/06/moving-to-zsh/)

### Commands

Let's put your Googlin' skills to the test! In breakout rooms, research the following commands and come up with your own definition for what they do. We will share out what each command does and model how to use them as a whole group!

#### Action Commands
- `mkdir`
- `cd`
- `cd ..`
- `touch`
- `clear`

#### Safe/Informative Commands
- `pwd`
- `ls`

#### Destructive Commands
- `rm`
- `rm -rf`

<p class="toggle-show">Click the ðŸ¤– to see how these commands work</p>
<div class="toggle-content hidden">  
In this section on command prompts, we'll learn (or review) the commands below. We'll look at all 10 together (take notes!), then you'll go into breakout rooms to practice them.


##### Action Commands
<ul>
  <li><a href="#mkdir" title="">mkdir</a></li>
  <li><a href="#cd" title="">cd</a></li>
  <li><a href="#cddot" title="">cd ..</a></li>
  <li><a href="#touch" title="">touch</a></li>
  <li><a href="#clear" title="">clear</a></li>
</ul>

##### Safe/Informative Commands
<ul>
  <li><a href="#pwd" title="">pwd</a></li>
  <li><a href="#ls" title="">ls</a></li>
</ul>

##### Destructive Commands
<ul>
  <li><a href="#rm" title="">rm</a></li>
  <li><a href="#rmrecursive" title="">rm -rf</a></li>
</ul>

<a name="pwd"></a>
### 1. Where am I? (`pwd`)

When you open the terminal, you will be in your home directory. Being in various directories will allow you to do different things, just like you can do different things at home vs. on vacation vs. at work.

To figure out where you are in your computer's directories, type `pwd` after the command prompt. `pwd` stands for "print working directory"

```
timo@Tims-MacBook-Pro:~$ pwd
/Users/timo
```

You'll see the path from the root of your computer to your current directory.

<a name="mkdir"></a>
### 2. Make a Directory (`mkdir`)

To make a folder using the visual interface of Finder, this is what you might do:


<img src="images/mkdir.gif" alt="making a folder using finder" style="height: 250px">

We can make new directories with the `mkdir` command. Unlike `pwd` where we didn't need to type anything else, we'll need to add a name for the directory. Keep your directories lowercase with no spaces. If you need to use a space, use the underscore (\_).

For example, the following two commands will create two directories called `work_spreadsheets` and `latest_projects`:

```
timo@Tims-MacBook-Pro:~$ mkdir work_spreadsheets
timo@Tims-MacBook-Pro:~$ mkdir latest_projects
```

You won't get any confirmation that your directory was created -- you'll just see a new command prompt ready for your next comamnd.

<a name="ls"></a>
### 3. Listing Contents of a Directory (`ls`)

With a visual interface (as shown in the gif above), you can easily see the contents of a directory. On the command line, it's a little different.

To check what's inside of a directory, we use the `ls` command which stands for list (although I like to think to myself: "list stuff"). As an example, let's assume that I have the directories and files from this diagram on my computer:

<div class="flex-container">
  <div>
    <img src="images/files_directories_2.png" alt="files and directories 2">
  </div>
  <div>
    If I was in the essays directory and I typed ls, this is what I'd see:

  <pre>timo@Tims-MacBook-Pro:~/essays$ ls
  book_projects    life_lessons.docx    notes.docx</pre>

  <p>You will only see the directories and files that are directly inside of where you are. You will not see any directories or files that are nested down the path. This is why we do not see the contents of book_projects listed.</p>

  <p>Now assume we're in the book_projects directory. If I type ls, I'll see this:</p>

  <pre>timo@Tims-MacBook-Pro:~/essays/book_projects$ ls
  literary_analysis.docx    book_report.docx</pre>

  </div>
</div>

<a name="cd"></a>
### 4. Go Into a Directory (cd)

You can move into a directory using the `cd` command, which stands for "change directory". After `cd`, type the name of the directory you want to go into.

<div class="flex-container">
  <div>
    <img src="images/files_directories_2.png" alt="files and directories 2">
  </div>
  <div>
    For example, if I was in the <code>essays</code> directory and wanted to move into the <code>book_projects</code> directory to see my documents, I would type this:
<pre>
timo@Tims-MacBook-Pro:~/essays$ cd book_projects
timo@Tims-MacBook-Pro:~/essays/book_projects$
</pre>

We see that the second command prompt now lists the path of new directory that we're in.

From there, if I used the <code>ls</code> command, I would be able to see the contents of my folder:

<pre>
timo@Tims-MacBook-Pro:~/essays/book_projects$ ls
literary_analysis.docx    book_report.docx
</pre>
  </div>
</div>

<div class="things-to-note">
  <h4>Things to Note</h4>
  <ol>
    <li>You can't pick any random directory from your computer to give to the cd command. It has to be a directory inside wherever you currently are (or you need to use the full path to get to that directory, which we won't talk about today).</li>
  </ol>
</div>

<a name="cddot"></a>
### 5. Get Out of a Directory (cd ..)

To get out of a directory you're in, we use `cd ..` (with a space between the d and the first dot). This means "go back up one level."

If I'm in the `book_projects` directory and I want to get back to `essays`, this is what I'd type:

```
timo@Tims-MacBook-Pro:~/essays/book_projects$ cd ..
timo@Tims-MacBook-Pro:~/essays$
```

Notice that my path no longer includes `book_projects` because I'm outside of that folder now.

**Note** You never want to cd into a directory above your home directory. This area requires admin permissions, and there is no practical use case for being there.

<div class="try-it">
  <h3>Try It: cd and cd ..</h3>
  <p>Let's try to figure out the following scenarios together.</p>
  <div class="flex-container">
    <div>
      <img src="images/files_directories_3.png" alt="files and directories 2">
    </div>
    <div>

      <p>If I'm in the <code>projects_to_delegate</code> directory, what <strong>two commands</strong> do I need to type to get to <code>to_do</code>?</p>
      <p><small>(We'll learn how to combine these momentarily)</small></p>
      <textarea name="" style="width:100%;"></textarea>
      <p>I'm in the <code>home</code> directory. What <strong>three commands</strong> do I need to type to get to <code>projects_to_delegate</code>?</p>
      <p><small>(We'll learn how to combine these momentarily)</small></p>
      <textarea rows="3" name="" style="width:100%;"></textarea>

      <textarea rows="3" name="" style="width:100%;"></textarea>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<div class="things-to-note">
  <h4>Things to Note</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>One can combine commands to navigate multiple levels through your directory structure. </li>
    <li>For the third example in the previous <strong>Try It</strong> section, one could navigate to the <code>projects_to_delegate</code> directory as long as one knows the path:</li>
    <code>cd ../work/projects_to_delegate</code>
    <li>For the fourth and final example above:</li>
    <code>cd ../../home</code>   
    <li>Each level in the path is spearated by a <code>/</code></li>
  </ul>
</div>

<a name="touch"></a>
### 6. Make a File (touch)

We know how to make directories (or folders) using the `mkdir` command. In order to make files inside of those directories, we use `touch`. The following two commands show how I would make two new files, `chapter_1.md` and `chapter_2.md`:

```
timo@Tims-MacBook-Pro:~/latest_projects$ touch chapter_1.md
timo@Tims-MacBook-Pro:~/latest_projects$ touch chapter_2.md
```

We don't see any confirmation that the file was created, but we can use `ls` to see what's inside the directory:

```
timo@Tims-MacBook-Pro:~/latest_projects $ ls
chapter_1.md    chapter_2.md
```

<a name="clear"></a>
### 6. Clear your terminal (clear)

Sometimes when you've entered a lot of terminal commands, your terimal can get pretty cluttered. You can always use `clear` to "clean up" your terminal workspace! 

<a name="rm"></a>
### 7. Remove a File (rm)

In the past, you've probably gotten rid of files by using the `Move to trash` command or dragging them into the trash, like this:

<img src="images/filetotrash.gif" alt="file to trash" style="height: 250px;">

We can remove files from the command line using the `rm` command, like this:

```
timo@Tims-MacBook-Pro:~/latest_projects $ rm chapter_1.md
```

Again, we don't get a confirmation, but if I were to `ls` right now, nothing would appear since the directory is now empty.

```
timo@Tims-MacBook-Pro:~/latest_projects $ ls
chapter_2.md
```

<div class="things-to-note">
  <h4>Things to Note</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>A file removed using the <code>rm</code> command <strong>does not</strong> go into your trash where you could restore it later.</li>
    <li>Although it may be possible to recover files deleted with <code>rm</code>, it is a difficult process requiring special tools and time. For now, assume that any file you remove using the <code>rm</code> command is gone for good.</li>
  </ul>
</div>

<a name="rmrecursive"></a>
### 9. Remove a Directory and Its Contents (rm -rf)

We can use `rm` to remove a file, but we use a different command when we're removing a directory. Since a directory could potentially contain other files and directories inside of it, we use `rm -rf` which stands for remove recursively, or go inside this directory and remove everything inside of it as well.

In order to remove a directory, you must be OUTSIDE of that directory. For example, if I'm inside a `books` directory and I want to remove it, I first need to get out of it using `cd ..`, then use the `rm -rf books`:

```
timo@Tims-MacBook-Pro:~/latest_projects/books$ cd ..
timo@Tims-MacBook-Pro:~/latest_projects$ rm -rf books
```

Now when I type `ls`, I will no longer see `books` listed.

        <p>We'll work through these exercises together.</p>
        <strong>For this scenario, assume that each question is independent of the rest, and that the starting point is always the diagram to the left.</strong>

### Putting it All Together - groups of 2 or 3 (10 minutes)

<p>At this point, we'll split into breakout rooms. The person whose name first name starts with the letter closest to T will share their screen by clicking the green "Share Screen" button. We will call this person the <span class="vocab">driver</span>. Every other person in the room will be a <span class="vocab">navigator</span>.</p>

<p>The driver will be the person typing the commands, but the navigators should be the ones who brainstorm what comes next or what to type. In addition to naming the steps, discuss <strong>why</strong> you are doing each step, or <strong>what</strong> exactly is taking place in each step.</p>

<p>If you are already comfortable with commands, your challenge during the breakout is somewhat more difficult: your goal is to focus on your explanations, communication, and ability to gauge whether or not another person understands you.</p>

#### Demo: Driver-Navigator Format

1. Type `cd` to get to your home directory (you'll probably already be here, but do it just to be sure)
1. Make a new directory called `terminal_practice`
1. Move into that directory
1. Print your current directory
1. Make a file called `favorite_foods.md`
1. List the contents of your directory (you should see just your `favorite_foods.md` file appear)
1. Use Atom add your #1 favorite food to the file
1. Delete the `favorite_foods.md` file
1. Get back out of the `terminal_practice` directory
1. Remove the `terminal_practice` directory

#### Challenge #1

For this next challenge, the person whose name is next closest to the letter T will share their screen and become the driver.

1. Type `cd` to get to your home directory (you'll probably already be here, but do it just to be sure)
1. Make a new directory called `my_first_projects`
1. Make another new directory called `my_other_projects`
1. List the contents of your directory (you should see these two directories you just made in the list)
1. Remove the `my_other_projects` directory
1. Move into the `my_first_projects` directory
1. Make a file called `ruby.md`
1. Make a file called `javascript.md`
1. Make a file called `python.md`
1. List the contents of your directory (you should see the three files you just created)
1. Delete the `ruby.md` file but leave the others
1. Get back out of the `my_first_projects` directory
1. List the contents of your directory (you should see `my_first_projects`)
1. Remove the `my_first_projects` directory

#### Challenge #2

The person who has not yet been the driver will share their screen.

1. Type `cd` to get to your home directory (you'll probably already be here, but do it just to be sure)
1. Make a new directory called `session3_practice`
1. Move into the `session3_practice` directory
1. Print the path to your current directory
1. Make a file called `terminal.md`
1. List the contents of your directory (you should see the `terminal.md` file you just created)
1. Add the text "The terminal is an interface to give commands to the computer" to the `terminal.md` file
1. Get back out of the `session3_practice` directory
1. Remove the `session3_practice` directory

## Close Out

Key takeaways from today:
* You should have a better understanding of the skills + mindsets necessary to succeed at Turing

## Homework

Find the homework in your Mod 0 Trello Board. Contact your instructors if you're stuck (or better yet, post in the public slack channel as you're likely not the only one running in to that issue)

Also, please note that the Mod 1 Prework takes about 40 hours total to complete. Part of your HW this week is to create a calendar for Mod 0 where you can plan how to spend your time on classes, HW, and the Mod 1 Prework! 

**If you find yourself falling behind, it is your responsibility to reach out to your TAs early!**

## Keyboard Shortcuts

Most computer users rely heavily on the mouse to open applications, interact with programs, etc. You might think that you're quick with a mouse, but just wait until you get good at <span class="vocab">keyboard shortcuts</span>.

Initially, your flow will be slower as you learn and memorize each of the shortcuts. However, if you force yourself to use these shortcuts, you'll become MUCH faster in the long run.
