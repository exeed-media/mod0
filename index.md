## What is Mod 0?

Mod 0 is a prerequisite course for both of the programs at Turing. It is a structured series of 5 sessions which take place remotely during the evening, and ideally starts 6 weeks before you begin your full-time FEE or BEE course at Turing. These classes are not in person, and are conducted fully remotely via Zoom. Please check the [calendar]({{ site.baseurl }}/calendar) for session dates.

The goals of mod 0 are to:
* Understand the systems and behaviors needed to be successful at Turing and as a software developer
* Understand foundational technical concepts needed for Mod 1
* Begin to break down social walls and build community in your future cohort

The key tools and concepts we go over in mod 0 are:
* Learning strategies
