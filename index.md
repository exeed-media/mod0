## What is Mod 0?

Mod 0 is a prerequisite course for both of the programs at Turing. It is a structured series of 5 sessions which are conducted fully remotely via Zoom. Please check the [calendar]({{ site.baseurl }}/calendar) for session dates and times.

The goal of Mod 0 is to ensure you are ready to begin engaging with technical content on the first day of Mod 1. We do this by supporting you in the following areas:
* Becoming familiar with the systems and tools we use at Turing
* Setting your expectations for what engagement, productive struggle, and feedback will be like as a Turing student
* Developing strategies to thrive in a rigorous, remote learning environment

## What will we cover in Mod 0?

* Remote Learning Strategies
* Asking Technical Questions
* Collaborating on Technical Work
* Git and GitHub Workflows
