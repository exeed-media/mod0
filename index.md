  <h2>Welcome to Mod 0</h2>
  <p>The purpose of Mod 0 is to ensure you are ready to begin engaging with technical content on the first day of Mod 1. The course does this by supporting students in the following areas:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Becoming familiar with the systems and tools we use at Turing</li>
    <li>Setting your expectations for what engagement, productive struggle, and feedback will be like as a Turing student</li>
    <li>Developing strategies to thrive in a rigorous, remote learning environment</li>
  </ul>
  <br>
  <p>It is expected that students arrive to your first Mod 0 Session prepared to engage, which includes having their computer, notebook, and workspace set up. Students can prepare by carefully following the directions on the Computer Setup page.</p>
