## Exercises

There are 3 sets of exercises for this evaluation. Record your screen and audio using Loom while completing Exercise #1 from the evaluation articulating exactly what you are doing every step of the way with technical vocabulary.

Note: Some language used in these prompts might be new to you. This is intentional and designed to support you in being flexible while reading documentation and specifications (as that is an essential skill for a developer to have). Use your context clues, make educated guesses with the knowledge you have.

  <h3>Exercise 1: Objects</h3>
  <p>For this exercise, use a Git workflow.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>In a mod_0 directory, create a new directory called <code>evaluation</code>. Inside of that directory, touch a file called <code>objectLiteralPractice</code>. Initialize a Git repository.</li>
    <li>Define a variable named <code>person</code> that stores an Object Literal. This Object should have 4 key-value pairs; you choose the key and use appropriate Data Types for the values.</li>
    <li>Write code to print the entire Object.</li>
    <li>Write code to print one of the values based on the key.</li>
    <li>Run the file in the Terminal to verify your code is working as expected.</li>
    <li>Programmatically add 2 more key-value pairs to the Object.</li>
    <li>Programmatically print out all the keys.</li>
    <li>Run the file in the Terminal to verify your code is working as expected.</li>
    <li>Run <code>git log</code>. Does your commit history tell the story of your progress on this challenge?</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Pairing Exercise 2: For Statements</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>In your evaluation directory, create a new directory called <code>pairing</code>. Inside of that directory, touch a file called <code>friends</code>. Initialize a Git repository.</li>
    <li>Define a variable that stores an Array containing 8 Numbers between 1 and 100.</li>
    <li>Write a program that checks each Number, and prints out only those above 30.</li>
    <li>Run the file in the Terminal to verify your code is working as expected.</li>
    <li>Create a GitHub repository.</li>
    <li>Push your work from the local repository to the remote repository.</li>
    <li>Don't modify or delete any of your previous code; write another method that will check each Number from the original Array, and print out only those under 60.</li>
    <li>Push that new work up to the remote repository.</li>
  </ul>
</div>

<div class="s-card">
  <h3>Exercise 3: Guess the Number Game</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>In your evaluation directory, create a new directory called <code>game</code>. Inside the directory touch a file called <code>guess_number</code>. Initialize a Git repository.</li>
    <li>The computer picks a random number in range between 1 and 10 and prompts the player to guess that number. Each time the player guesses, the computer should give the player a hint as to whether the number is too high or too low. The computer should also keep track of the number of guesses. Once the player guesses the correct number, the computer should present the number of guesses and ask if the player would like to play again.</li>
    <li>Run the file in the Terminal to verify your code is working as expected.</li>
    <li>Create a GitHub repository.</li>
    <li>Push your work from the local repository to the remote repository.</li>    
  </ul>  
</div>
```
  Example Output:
  Let's play Guess the Number.
  I have my number. What's your guess?
  1
  Too low.  Guess again: 5
  Too high. Guess again: 2
  You got it in 3 guesses!
  Play again? n
  Goodbye!
```

## Reflection

Take a moment to reflect independently after this exercise.
- In what areas do you feel confident and in what areas might you need to improve before you continue?
- What is one step you could take to prepare for your next module?
- What progress have you made on the areas of growth you identified?

There is nothing to submit after completing this reflection, but take note of your progress and any areas in which you would like to continue growing.
