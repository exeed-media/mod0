title: Pairing Session 4
---

## Learning Goals

- Get to know another classmate and collaborate on technical work
- Fluently screen share, type in front of others, and communicate technical concepts

## Prepare

Before meeting with your partner, identify 1-2 technical topics covered in Mod 0 that have been most challenging or interesting so far. Go back to those lessons and find a practice activity that you will Navigate for. Bookmark the link, or copy-and-paste the text in your notes app or a Slack DM to yourself; come prepared to the session ready to work on it!

## Mini-DTR

Spend a few minutes getting to know each other and sharing what you selected for your pairing exercise. Then, decide who will Drive and who will Navigate first.

## Exercises

No exercises are provided as you each brought exercises to the pairing session!

## Reflection

Take a moment to reflect independently after this exercise.
- What are you proud of?
- How have you seen yourself grow over the course of these 4 pairing sessions?
- What is one thing you want to hold yourself accountable to during the final evaluation?

There is nothing to submit anything after completing this exercise, but let's take a moment to spread some joy! Send your partner a quick DM in Slack sharing one action they took during this paired session that helped you. Use the [evaluation rubric](https://turingschool.notion.site/turingschool/9d22c7265b4e4d75a994496605ec8e94?v=3232bf7092914bb998b63b3f12c9be62) as a guide to give them some actionable positive feedback they can take with them into their final eval. You can choose to highlight their communication, collaboration or their technical skills!
