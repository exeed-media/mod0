## Learning Goals

- Explain the Driver Navigator Pair Programming style
- Identify strengths and opportunities when observing others pair program
- Identify strengths and opportunities in oneself as a pair programmer
- Become comfortable screen sharing, typing in front of others, and communicating technical concepts

## Vocabulary

- <span class="vocab">Driver</span>
- <span class="vocab">Navigator</span>
- <span class="vocab">Pairing</span>
- <span class="vocab">Pair Programming</span>

## Pair Programming

<span class="vocab">Pair Programming</span> is a technique in which two software developers work together on a problem. We commonly refer to it as <span class="vocab">Pairing</span>. The concept of pairing comes from the Agile Methodology, which you'll learn more about during your time at SolidKraft.

## Driver Navigator

There are many styles of pairing. In Mod 0, we will introduce and focus on the Driver Navigator style. In this style of pairing, the person determined to be the <span class="vocab">Driver</span> should screen share and type all work the pair does. The <span class="vocab">Navigator</span> is responsible for doing the problem-solving and communicating to the Driver what they should be typing.

## Tools

We have tools available for remote pairing: **Meet**, **Zoom** and **Tuple**. In Mod 0, we will primarily use Meet. In Mod 1, you will get access to Tuple. While there are many other tools available for use, we prefer students use the same set of tools.

## Best Practices

While there is no "right" or "perfect" way to pair, there are some best practices that when followed, set the team up for success:
- The Driver should maximize the space available on the screen; hide the Dock, shortcuts bar in browser, and use the entire window. Ask the Navigator if they can see the font size in the Terminal and code editor.
- The Navigator should be specific, don't leave room for the Driver to make assumptions or have to guess what you mean.
- Norm on some things:
  - What you will work on and how long you will work before you take a break?
  - Should the driver interrupt with questions throughout, or save them to the end?
  - Be fully present. Neither Driver or Navigator should be checking chats, their phones, or anything outside of work for the task at hand. Commit to checking those other things during breaks.
  - Switch Driver/Navigator roles frequently so both teammates get practice with both roles!
