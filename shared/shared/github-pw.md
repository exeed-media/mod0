When you see any live lesson on your calendar - in Mod 0, 1 and beyond, it's a best practice to preview the content. Sometimes, instructors may provide additional resources - from Turing or outside. Other times, they will ask you to skim the lesson. Having a high-level understanding of what concepts will be presented, key vocabulary, and connections to prior knowledge will allow you to engage deeply, ask better questions, and get more out of the lesson. In Mod 0, we'll provide guidance and reflection opportunities to help you build this habit. When you go to Mod 1, it will be expected that you make the time on your calendar and have the discipline to follow through on doing this, but guidance may not be provided.

Complete the two tasks that follow before coming to the lesson. You don't need to be an expert in these areas, but it's expected you come to the lesson having done this and ready to engage in asking questions and discussing the topics.
